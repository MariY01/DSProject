    "To address my question of interest, I will use K-NN regression. This is because there might be more than one variable (explanatory variable) influencing the length of the play time (response variable) and I'm trying to make a model that predicts numerical response variable; therefore, K-NN regression suite the situation the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this method, at the beginning, I will split the dataset into training set and testint set with the ratio of 75 to 25. In order to find which variable(s) influence the length of the play time of a player, I first need to use predictor selection algorithm, and to do so, I will use cross validation method by spliting the training set into 5 folds, after the original dataset is split into training and testing set.\n",
